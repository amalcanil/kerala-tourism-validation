          <p>
            Located 60 km from the Thrissur district of Kerala, Athirapally Falls is a marvellous cascade of frothy
            waters that makes its way from the Anamudi mountains of the Western Ghats. Also called as Bahubali
            Waterfall, this 80 ft high and 330 ft wide marvel is the largest waterfall in Kerala. It is often referred
            to as the "Niagara Falls of India". From here, the Athirapally falls flows through the verdant greenery of
            Vazhachal Forest toward the Arabian Sea, creating a spectacular vista of scintillating water, emerald
            jungles and azure sky. <br>
            When you land in Athirapally, you are greeted with the sight of charming green Sholayar Peaks peering over
            the rushing gush of the falls. Standing against the backdrop of a rustling jungle foliage, this many films
            and music videos are shot here. Bird lovers cannot miss this place, for it is the only place in the Western
            Ghats where four endangered Hornbill species are seen. There is a pool above the falls where you can relax
            and unwind. To get a view of the waterfall, one needs to get down from the mountain for about 100 meters.
