          <p>
            Idukki District came into existence on the 26th January, 1972 as per the notification No. 54131/C2/71/RD
            dated the 24th January, 1972, carving out Devikulam, Udumbanchola and Peerumade Taluks from erstwhile
            Kottayam District and Thodupuzha Taluk (excluding Kalloorkad Village and portion of Manjalloor Village
            included in Kalloorkad and Manjalloor Panchayats) of erstwhile Ernakulam District. The jurisdiction was
            slightly altered by a subsequent notification No.7754/C2/72/RD dated the 14th February, 1972. The name
            Idukki was derived from the word ‘Idukku’ which means a gorge. <br>
            As per G.O.(MS)/No.1026/82/RD dated 29.10.1982, North Pamba Valley area and the area around Sabarimala
            Sannidhanam in Mlappara Village of Peerumade Taluk were transferred to Pathanamthitta District. At present,
            the District consists of 5 Taluks viz., Devikulam, Udumbanchola, Thodupuzha, Peerumade and Idukki.

          <p>
            The Idukki dam is constructed across the Periyar River, in a valley between the Kuravan and Kurathi hills in
            Kerala. The awe-inspiring, majestic dam, which stands at 167.68 meters (550 ft), is one of the highest arch
            dams in Asia. The dam, which is one of the Idukki tourist places, constructed by the Kerala government in
            1975 and supports 780 MW hydroelectric power station that draws electricity from this dam. <br>

            lake, which is created by the 3 dams, Idukki dam, Cheruthoni and Kulamavu, captivate the visitors.
